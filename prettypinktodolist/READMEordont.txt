Hi!
This was my first project I have ever actually *finished*. (sharkfacts was my first project however it was sadly abandoned and will continue to be until 2024) 
This project was an attempt to practice addEventListeners, and it is my first project using javascript.. I will admit that I had a few difficulties and consulted the internet to help me build specific features. I am still learning that copying code off another page for use with your own isn’t cheating. This was a simple cute pink to do list that I wanted to build in 24 hours.
